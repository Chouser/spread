== The map constructor

A map constructor for Clojure/Script
which emulates JavaScript's ES6 object creation shorthand
by introducing shorthand notation.

    {us.chouser/spread {:mvn/version "0.0.1"}}

== Usage

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[us.chouser.spread :refer [k.]])

(k. :a "alpha")          ;;=> {:a "alpha"}

(let [b "beta"]
  (k. b, :c "charlie"))  ;;=> {:b "beta" :c "charlie"}

(let [b "beta"
      m {:x 7, :y 9}]
  (k. b, ~@m))          ;;=> {:b "beta" :x 7 :y 9}
----

Mix and match keyword/value pairs, bare symbols, and ellipsis (spread) prefixes
to construct a map. Similar to
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#property_definitions[property shorthand] and
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#spread_properties[spread syntax]
in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer[JavaScript Object initializers]

The `k.` macro (a.k.a. `keys.`) works well for constructing
maps that will be destructured with `{:keys []}`. Also available are `strs.` and
`syms.` macros for `{:strs []}` and `{:syms []}` destructuring respectively.

See link:src/test/us.chouser/spread_test.clj[] for all usages.

=== Sequences, vectors and sets

Clojure has a built-in spread operator that you should prefer:

    `[0 1 ~@(range 2 4)] => [0 1 2 3]

== Rationale

ES6 introduced object initialization shorthand notation to JavaScript,
which has been widely adopted and accepted as a concise and clear way to create data literals.
Allowing for symbols to represent pairs is syntactic sugar that saves repetition at the cost of extra syntax.
The evidence that this is reasonable and desirable is that the syntax was quickly adopted by the JavaScript community.

The spread notation was selected to match Clojure's exising `~@` syntax for sequences.
Unfortunately `~@` does not work inside maps because the Clojure reader enforces an even number of forms inside a map literal,
without considering the effects of unsplicing:

[source,clojure]
----
`{0 1 ~@(range 2 4)} => Exception
----

Improving the Clojure reader to handle this case would appear to be a reasonable thing to do.

It is possible to trick the reader by providing 2 `~@` forms:

[source,clojure]
----
`{0 1 ~@(range 2 4) ~@nil}
=> {0 1, 2 3}
----

Alternative notations considered were `...` and `&` which are both interesting.
`&` is symmetrical with destructuring.
`...` is more common outside of Clojure.
Both introduce a minor ambiguity where `...m` is the same as `... m` (or `&m` is the same as `& m`).
`~@` Does not have this ambiguity because it always means `(unquote-splicing <expr>)` whether used with a symbol or any other expression.

== Goals

Given some pre-existing bindings...

[source,clojure]
----
(def a "alpha")
(def b "beta")
(def m {:foo :bar})
----

=== Compatible with existing map construction

`(k. :k 100)` => `{:k 100}`

=== A symbol is read as a key value pair

`(k. a b)` => `{:a "alpha", :b "beta"}`

=== Escaping

`(k. ~a ~b)` => `{"alpha" "beta"}`

=== Symbol pairing only occurs in the key position

`(k. ~a b)` => `{"alpha" "beta"}`

=== Spreading

`(k. ~@m)` => `{:foo :bar}`

=== Inline expressions

`(k. ~@(range 4))` => `{0 1, 2 3}`

=== Mixing, matching, and composing

`(k. a b :c 3 ~a 5 ~@m ~@(range 10 14) ~@(strs. a b))`
=> `{:a "alpha", :b "beta", :c 3, "alpha" 5, :foo :bar, 10 11, 12 13, "a" "alpha", "b" "beta"}`

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator[Gerardus Mercator] was an influential cartographer who also liked making maps.
I'm pretty sure he would approve of a map construction macro.
So you should too.
